I'm Arthur and I love learning and building. I'm interested in neuroscience and AI, particularly methods that help us understand how we think and learn as well as applications to advance technology for remedying disease.

I love trying new cafes and restaurants, reading, and practicing taekwondo. I'm also learning to blog and slowly finding my content fit. Right now, I want to learn more about VC, protein design, geometric deep learning, dynamical systems, food as medicine, foreign languages, world modeling, and digital humans.

Say hi at artliang [at] mit [dot] edu, I'm always looking for good reads and eats!

These days, I
======
* study [Computer Science and Neuroscience](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-major-course-6-9/) and [Mathematics](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/thoughts-on-mathmit/) at MIT.
* am spending a semester abroad at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), waiting to hit the Alps with my new board in the winter.
* intern at [Ritual](https://ritual.net/), researching LLM interpretability.
* research with [Manolis Kellis's group](https://compbio.mit.edu/) @ CSAIL, developing new methods for protein representational learning and substructure-aware protein language models.
* research with [Memming Park's group](https://fchampalimaud.org/research/groups/memming-park) @ Champalimaud Foundation, learning about nonlinear neural dynamics and finding symmetries in continuous attractors.
* cook for people and throw themed pop-ups around campus with [MIT MINCE](https://www.mitmince.com/).
* train and compete with [MIT Sport Taekwondo](https://web.mit.edu/taekwondo/), also serve(d) as Tournament Coordinator and Social Chair.
* volunteer as an Emergency Medical Technician as part of [MIT EMS](https://ems.mit.edu/).

Once upon a time, I
======
* worked as an undergraduate researcher with [Tommi S. Jaakkola's group](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/) @ CSAIL, investigating protein structure-language latent embeddings and controlled protein generation with flow matching, language models, and latent diffusion models.
* interned at [Altera](https://altera.al/), building digital human beings that care about people.
* interned at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), developing causal inference and user segmentation methods on the trading team.
* interned as a machine learning researcher with the AI team at [Boeing Korea (BKETC)](https://www.boeing.co.kr/boeing-korea/about-boeing-korea) where I built an RL agent for tail swapping and implemented large vision models for expediting inspection procedures.
* spent two winter breaks developing and delivering hands-on workshops on biology, neuroscience, and medicine exemplifying MIT's _mens et manus_ motto to high schoolers at [Korea International School](https://www.kis.or.kr/) as part of [MIT MISTI Global Teaching Labs](https://misti.mit.edu/mit-korea).
* served as the Operations Lead for [MIT Hacking Medicine](https://www.hackingmedicine.mit.edu/), helping to organize healthcare hackathons like our annual flagship Grand Hack.
* worked as an undergraduate researcher with the [MetaConscious Group @ MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.metaconscious.org/), building more biologically-plausible neural network architectures with realistic visual inputs for experimental neuroscience tasks.
* got my start with research in high school, where I got my feet wet with experimental neuroscience and pharmacology, and won awards at [ISEF](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/)
