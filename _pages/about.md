**This website is currently under construction so please excuse its appearance!**

I'm Arthur and I love learning and building. I'm interested in medicine, particularly using machine learning to advance therapeutics and procedures for remedying neurological diseases.

I love cafe hopping, reading, consuming Korean media, and practicing taekwondo. I'm also a beginner blogger currently still trying to find my content fit. Right now, I want to learn more about VC, geometric deep learning, foreign languages, and digital humans.

Say hi at artliang [at] mit [dot] edu, I'd love to chat!

Currently, I
======
* study [Computer Science and Neuroscience](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-major-course-6-9/) and [Mathematics](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/thoughts-on-mathmit/) at MIT.
* research with [Tommi S. Jaakkola's group](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/) and [Manolis Kellis's group]([https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/](https://compbio.mit.edu/)) @ CSAIL, investigating protein structure-language latent embeddings and controlled protein generation with flow matching, diffusion, and language models.
* intern at [Altera](https://altera.al/), building digital human beings that care about people.
* volunteer as an Emergency Medical Technician as part of [MIT EMS](https://ems.mit.edu/).
* train and compete with [MIT Sport Taekwondo](https://web.mit.edu/taekwondo/), also serve(d) as Tournament Coordinator and Social Chair.
* serve as the Operations Lead for [MIT Hacking Medicine](https://www.hackingmedicine.mit.edu/), helping to organize healthcare hackathons like our annual flagship Grand Hack.

Previously, I
======
* interned as a machine learning researcher with the AI team at [Boeing Korea (BKETC)](https://www.boeing.co.kr/boeing-korea/about-boeing-korea) where I built an RL agent for tail swapping and implemented large vision models for expediting inspection procedures.
* spent two winter breaks developing and delivering hands-on workshops on biology, neuroscience, and medicine exemplifying MIT's _mens et manus_ motto to high schoolers at [Korea International School](https://www.kis.or.kr/) as part of [MIT MISTI Global Teaching Labs](https://misti.mit.edu/mit-korea).
* worked as an undergraduate researcher with the [MetaConscious Group @ MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.metaconscious.org/) on building more biologically-plausible neural network architectures with realistic visual inputs for experimental neuroscience tasks.
* got my start with research in high school, where I got my feet wet with experimental neuroscience and pharmacology, and winning awards at [ISEF](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/)
