There's a particular kind of loneliness that comes from realizing you never really knew someone at all—especially someone who once felt essential to your survival. The funny thing about crisis friendships is how real they feel in the moment. When someone shows up for you during your worst week, it's easy to mistake their timing for destiny.

Like most, I've always been someone who cares deeply about how others perceive me, though I've become adept at wearing indifference like armor. I cultivate this persona of someone unbothered by external judgment, someone secure in their own convictions. But, when someone I respect sees me differently than I see myself, it stings.

The Sarah thing happened second semester freshman year. Something about collaboration on a problem set that crossed into academic integrity territory—one of those gray areas where the rules aren't as clear as they should be. I still don't know if I handled it right. What I remember is sitting in my dorm room afterward, feeling like everyone in our study group was looking at me differently, the weight of being misunderstood, the exhaustion of defending choices that felt right in the moment but looked questionable in retrospect. Like I'd revealed something about my character that couldn't be taken back.

Ellis texted me that night. Just an innocuous "want to grab dinner?" Nothing dramatic or loaded, which somehow made it more meaningful. We ended up at that mediocre Thai place on Bolyston, the one that's probably closed by now, and he listened while I tried to explain what had happened without sounding defensive. He didn't offer solutions or tell me everything would be fine. He just said, "That sounds really hard," and somehow, maybe it was the innocent sincerity in their voice, it resonated with me for the rest of the night. Ellis appeared during the turbulent misunderstanding like a lifeline. Not with grand gestures or dramatic declarations of loyalty, but with the quiet consistency of someone who simply showed up. Late-night conversations that stretched until dawn, the kind of presence that made MIT feel less overwhelming and more navigable. He was pre-med too, had the same obsessive relationship with his GPA, the same anxiety about whether we were smart enough to actually make it. We talked about our ambitions with the fervor of people who believed we could reshape the world, our approaches to college life aligning in ways that felt predestined.

Crisis has a way of creating intimacy. Shared struggle becomes shared identity, and suddenly you're convinced you've found your person—someone who sees the world through the same lens, who wants the same things, who understands you at a cellular level.

The shift happened gradually. Maybe it started when he became obsessed with internship recruiting—locking himself in his room to do case studies and practice LeetCode while I was still focused on research opportunities. I remember feeling surprised during a career fair when he admitted he'd switched from pursuing an MD to targeting banking and software engineering roles. "The hours are brutal, but the compensation is worth it," he'd said, as if we hadn't spent countless nights planning out our applications and MCAT study schedules. Or when he slowly disappeared from the campus activities we'd both loved—dropping the cooking club after his breakup, skimping on taking classes we had planned to take together. Small things that individually didn't sound alarms but started a pattern.

By spring of our sophomore year, our conversations felt different. Still friendly, still functional, but missing something I couldn't name. We'd study together and I'd find myself checking my phone more, inviting other friends over just to break the awkwardness. The easy flow we'd had during those first few months since the incident had calcified into something more effortful. I think we both sensed it but neither of us wanted to address it directly. It's easier to let friendships fade than to admit they were never as deep as they seemed. We started making fewer plans, responding to texts a little later, choosing different tables in the library. By junior year, we barely spoke beyond polite nods in passing.

The title of this reflection comes from that slow recognition—not words either of us spoke aloud, but the sentiment that hung between us as we both realized our mistake. We had constructed an entire friendship on a moment, mistaking situational compatibility for something deeper and more enduring, a false serendipity. The realization that stung wasn't that we'd grown apart—it was that we'd never actually been that close to begin with. The person who'd felt like my closest friend at MIT was essentially a stranger I'd trauma-bonded with over a mediocre pad thai and shared academic anxiety. We'd mistaken proximity and timing for genuine connection. There was no dramatic falling out, no moment of betrayal to point to. Just the gradual understanding that we had been circumstantial friends masquerading as kindred spirits. The person who had helped me navigate my first real social crisis at MIT was someone I didn't actually know at all.

I used to think I would reach out to Ellis eventually, extend an invitation to reconnect over coffee and see if there was still something salvageable between us. But what would I even say? "Remember when we were friends for four months sophomore year?" It felt arbitrary, like trying to restart something that had never really existed in the first place.

Maybe that's okay. Maybe Ellis showed up exactly when I needed someone to show up, and that's enough. I used to think failed friendships were a moral failing, evidence that I hadn't tried hard enough or cared enough. But some people are meant to be transient—entering your life precisely when you need them most, serving their purpose with grace and intention, and then naturally receding as you both evolve into versions of yourselves that no longer require that particular connection. Ellis helped me get through one of my first real social crises at college. That gift doesn't diminish because our friendship didn't endure.

We are all more complex than the versions of ourselves we present during our most vulnerable moments. The person who sees you clearly in crisis may not recognize you at all in calm. And that's not anyone's fault—it's just how human connection works, messier and more temporary than we like to admit.

Some people stay. Others leave their mark and move on. Both have value. Both deserve gratitude.
