I recently stumbled upon Ben Kuhn's blogroll. 

Not only has he inspired me to regularly set aside time to blog and introduced me to EA, but he's also taught me to have conviction in whatever it is that I do. To live a life worth living. To die without regrets.

And that the best way to plan all this out and execute it to the T is to just look at the answer keys laid out in front of me that is, look to the people around me who have led, at one point or another, the life I dream of for the answers. Sure they may be cryptic at times because indeed no one has lived *my* life. After all, who else likes to eat their burgers deconstructed halfway in? The important question for me, however, is how to prioritize

- superficial advice vs specific, actionable advice
- building professional relationships
- starting anew at MIT, will strive to start off on the right foot
- first step in the right direction is the most important
