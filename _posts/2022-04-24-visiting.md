It's April, the time of the year when all the anxious high school seniors flock to visit the place they'll be spending the next four years of their lives. 

Each student is there trying to soak in different aspects of each college, weighing their options. Some create objective pros and cons lists, some are just there to have a good time (some have such great times that they commit right then and there without consulting their parents), while others try to beat FOMO and hit up every single event going on. Regardless of one's intentions, it's generally a fun time where students meet like-minded peers from around the world, share contact info, and enjoy the free amenities.
